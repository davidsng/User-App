## Context: Why We're Building This

Everyone hates the sales, marketing, customer success and revops tool they use now. AI enables entirely new possibilities

The current GTM software landscape creates significant challenges:

### Problem 1: Prohibitive Cost and Complexity of Advanced GTM Capabilities

Larger companies use extensive GTM systems that create significant competitive advantages but are prohibitively expensive for startups and mid-market companies:

- **Sales Tools**: Salesforce/Hubspot, Gong, Seismic, Salesloft/Outreach for automating outbound sequences, coaching reps, managing sales content, and customer relationship data
- **Marketing Tools**: Marketo, Ahrefs, Sprout Social, Hubspot for lifecycle marketing, SEO optimization, content marketing, etc.
- **Customer Success Tools**: Gainsight/Churnzero/Planhat, Amplitude plus custom integrations for product usage insights, health scoring, and onboarding automation
- **RevOps Tools**: Clearbit/Apollo/Zoominfo, Leandata, Spiff, Clari for data enrichment, lead routing, commission calculations, and forecasting
- **Integration Layer**: Census or Hightouch to build custom connectors between data warehouse and various tools

This stack is financially out of reach for most companies:

- $100K-200K annually just for software licenses for a small team
- $20K-50K per integration for third-party implementation services
- 3-5 FTEs to operationalize and maintain the tech stack
- Engineering resources diverted from core product development

### Problem 2: Integration Nightmares and Organizational Complexity

The "Frankenstein" GTM stack creates downstream problems that worsen as companies grow:

- **Data Silos and Inconsistency**: Critical information is fragmented across tools, making it impossible to construct a complete view of customers. Teams waste time reconciling conflicting data (e.g., Customer Success and RevOps often disagree on basic metrics like number of paying customers).
- **Cross-Team Collaboration Barriers**: Teams operate in isolation (Sales in Salesforce, Marketing in Marketo, Customer Success in Gainsight). This prevents timely feedback loops and creates internal friction.
- **Escalating Maintenance Costs**: Companies continually add more specialized roles (Salesforce admins, GTM engineers, dedicated RevOps) just to keep systems functioning, creating a complex coordination problem that worsens with scale.
- **Poor User Experience**: Most GTM tools are designed for managers and admins rather than frontline teams, leading to poor adoption and productivity loss.

### Problem 3: RevOps Teams Caught in the Middle

Revenue Operations teams are expected to be strategic partners while drowning in tactical work:

- Constantly generating reports and fixing data issues
- Managing complex integrations and workflows
- Responding to ad-hoc requests from leadership
- Implementing and enforcing processes across fragmented systems
- Struggling to demonstrate their impact on the business

## Our solution: building an AI-native GTM software

Some notes:

- **No rigid, pre-set rules:** AI-native tools don't require narrowly defined rules or fields, enabling flexibility and adaptability.
- **Freedom from structured databases:** No need to "know the table" or maintain a specific data schema, allowing smoother handling of varied inputs.
- **Consistency through clear context:** With a well-defined system context and message tree, these tools can ensure consistent, accurate responses.
- **Elevated user support:** AI enables premium service for the long tail of users—instant email replies, personalized assistance—without excessive human overhead.
- **Less human-constrained growth:** Assign virtual CSMs to every user, analyze data quickly for insights, and explore new markets more rapidly.
- **"Autocomplete" experience:** The system can proactively suggest next steps or tasks, streamlining the user journey.
- **Integration flexibility:** Fewer limitations on how and where the tools can integrate, promoting seamless adoption across platforms.

## User Interface Vision

Our platform will feature a unified workspace that combines all key elements of the GTM workflow:

### Key Interface Components

   - Left sidebar for user/account navigation with categorization (support, new, target)
   - Functional navigation areas (Growth, Analytics, Roadmap)
   - Quick access to recently viewed accounts and prioritized items

2. **Account Workspace**:

   - Dual-panel interface with account details and contextual workspace
   - Company overview with tags and classification (e.g., Digital Native, Top 100)
   - Custom fields displaying key information
   - Current state section highlighting financial data and opportunities
   - AI-suggested action items with context-specific recommendations
   - People section for contact management
   - Timeline/history section for account activity

3. **Contextual Workspace**:

   - Tabbed interface (Action, Assets, Message Tree, Inspect)
   - Context-aware action suggestions based on current view
   - Different action sets for different functional areas
   - Chat and messaging capabilities integrated directly in the workspace
   - Asset management for related documents and content

4. **Intelligent Recommendations**:

## Message Tree Implementation

The Message Tree provides a structured approach to product communication, as shown in the Nansen Query example:

- **Origin/Founding Narrative**:

  - The problem being solved (e.g., "Many leading funds and web3 teams couldn't get high-quality programmatic access to blockchain data")
  - The change we want to create (e.g., "Today we want to make Nansen Query available to every company out there that is looking for something that just works really well")

- **Product Headline**: The core value proposition in a single statement (e.g., "Query is the only blockchain data platform that ambitious crypto teams need")

- **Value Props**: 2-3 supporting pillars of value:

  1. "Unique data sets. Comprehensive coverage. Fewer joins"
  2. "Queries that run 40X times faster. Unmatched productivity"
  3. "Professionally curated. Deeper insights"

- **Demonstrable Elements**:

  - **Value (ROI, benchmarks, data accuracy)**:

    - "14 blockchains - and increasing. X more than others"

## Customer Journey Analytics Implementation

Based on the flowchart shared, the platform will implement:

### 1. Dual Journey Tracking

- **Sales-Led Journey**: Lead Acquisition → Sales Development → Sales → Monetization → Retention & Expansion
- **Self-Serve Journey**: Lead Acquisition → Signup → Activation → Monetization → Retention & Expansion

### 2. Metrics Tracking at Each Stage

- **Lead Acquisition**:
  - Track inbound leads, product-qualified leads, outbound leads, event leads, paid media leads by source
  - Measure traffic through organic, portfolio, connect, and other self-serve channels
- **Sales Development/Signup**:
  - Track % acted on by rep, % converted to qualified leads, avg response time
  - Measure % conversion from landing page to signup, % referral rates
- **Sales/Activation**:
  - Track opportunity size, win rate, deal cycle length, ACV
  - Measure % activation rate for self-serve users
- **Monetization**:
  - Track ARR and upgrades to higher tiers
  - Measure % paid subscriber rate, % upgrade rates for different tiers
- **Retention & Expansion**:
  - Track % renewal rate, % product attach rate, NRR
  - Measure % cohort retention, % renewal rate, % successful onboarding

### 3. Visualization and Analysis Capabilities
